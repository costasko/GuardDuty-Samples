title: (Example) Attack Tree for S3 Bucket with Video Recordings

facts:
- ec2_creds: IMDS is accessible
  from:
  - reality:
  - remove_boundary
  - boundary_ip_range


attacks:
- external_actor: SSRF or other vuln exfiltrates creds
  from:
  - ec2_creds
- internal_actor: Internal actor with access exfiltrates creds
  from:
  - ec2_creds
- priv_esc: Role has permissions that lead to priv esc
  from:
  - external_actor
  - internal_actor
  - perm_boundary
- sts_endpoint: Attacker exfiltrates ARN of role - getcalleridentity
  from:
  - external_actor
  - perm_boundary
- remove_boundary: Attacker can remove boundary
  from:
  - perm_boundary
- boundary_ip_range: Boundary has IP range that can be replicated
  from:
  - perm_boundary:
- assume_role: Assume a different role
  from:
  - priv_esc:
- iam_role_enumeration: Account and/or other resource enumeration
  link: https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-role-enumeration-iam-p2/
  from:
  - sts_endpoint: 

mitigations:
- imdvsv2: IMDSv2 prevents ssrf from exfiltrating ec2 creds
  from:
  - external_actor
- perm_boundary: Network range boundary on compute role
  from:
  - internal_actor
  - external_actor
  - lambda_in_vpc
- scp_permissions_boundary: SCP to lock boundary
  from:
  - remove_boundary
- iprange: IP addresses and VPC IDs are unique to the bank
  from:
  - boundary_ip_range:
- cloudsplain: Remove all roles with iam:* 
  from:
  - assume_role:

goals:
- access_aws_resources: Access other AWS Resources
  from:
  - external_actor:
  - assume_role: 
- info_exfiltration: Other info exfiltration
  from:
  - iam_role_enumeration
